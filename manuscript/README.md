# Selfie: Computer Science for Everyone

### by Christoph Kirsch

This book is an introduction to computer science for people who use computers every day without knowing how they really work but always wanted to know how they actually work. The idea is to teach many of the surprisingly simple, basic principles in computer science that are relevant for truly understanding what is going on in a single book. The goal is to have people gain real confidence in using the most exciting machines ever invented for their everyday needs.
