This is the grammar of the C Star (C\*) programming language.

C\* is a tiny subset of the programming language C. C\* features global variable declarations with optional initialization as well as procedures with parameters and local variables. C\* has five statements (assignment, while loop, if-then-else, procedure call, and return) and standard arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`) and comparison (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`) operators. C\* includes the unary `*` operator for dereferencing pointers hence the name but excludes data types other than `uint64_t` and `uint64_t*`, bitwise and Boolean operators, and many other features. The C\* grammar is LL(1) with 6 keywords and 22 symbols. Whitespace as well as single-line (`//`) and multi-line (`/*` to `*/`) comments are ignored.

C\* Keywords: `uint64_t`, `void`, `if`, `else`, `while`, `return`

C\* Symbols: `integer`, `character`, `string`, `identifier`, `,`, `;`, `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `=`, `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`

with:

```
integer    = digit { digit } .

character  = "'" printable_character "'" .

string     = """ { printable_character } """ .

identifier = letter { letter | digit | "_" } .
```

and:

```
digit  = "0" | ... | "9" .

letter = "a" | ... | "z" | "A" | ... | "Z" .
```

C\* Grammar:

```

                   ( "void" | type ) identifier procedure } .

                    ( ";" | "{" { variable ";" } { statement } "}" ) .

simpleExpression = term { ( "+" | "-" ) term } .

term             = factor { ( "*" | "/" | "%" ) factor } .

factor           = [ cast ] [ "-" ] [ "*" ]
                    ( identifier | call | literal | string | "(" expression ")" ) .

while            = "while" "(" expression ")"
                             ( statement |
